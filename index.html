        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Hiring a lawyer can get pretty expensive in Pakistan. Two non-technical investors thought of an idea to
            create an AI-based lawyer that can process textual queries and answer them accordingly with citations to
            the PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) and Constitution. This is especially useful for people living in remote areas
            and even urban women looking to get a consultation privately. Luckily, you run a software development
            business and will be providing them services.

                    specific environment.</li>
                <li>The system needs to re-establish to recover the data directly affected by the suspended connection.
